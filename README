Old Distros
-------------

If your Linux distribution doesn't have the required versions of BeautifulSoup
or Httplib2, you'll need to bypass the system version. Below is an example for
Ubuntu and BeautifulSoup. Run the following from a terminal:

 $ sudo dpkg -P python-beautifulsoup # remove any system version
 $ sudo apt-get install python-pip
 $ sudo pip install beautifulsoup

Installation & Running
------------------------

Anki does not need installing, and can be run from the directory it is
extracted to. If you extracted it to ~/anki-2.0 for example, you can run Anki
by simply typing ~/anki-2.0/anki in a terminal.

If you'd like to install it system wide, change to the folder you extracted it
to, and run 'sudo make install'. The makefile also supports uninstalling.
